Hi, My name is Zhandos but you can call me @tosekk. I am from Kazakhstan.

I am a Technical Director for CG guys, and software developer for others. I primarily use SideFX Houdini and Blender that is why my main programming language is Python, though C/C++ are entering with baby steps into my life. In addition to all of that, I am learning Odin programming language which got its place in my heart after the first code.

I love creating systems that is why I love programming and procedural modeling. Actually, everything is fun inside Houdini :)

You can reach me via email: zhandos.kadyrkulov@gmail.com and twitter.
